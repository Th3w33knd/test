> How should I prepare for my mid-semester exams? Please tell me what all the topics are that he taught in this course, assuming that I have not read all the materials that he shared, so that I can see what topics I have missed. I am happy to read lengthy conversations. You do not have to cram all the information in one single response; I have also added my professor transcripts of teachings and his class notes. you can split it into multiple responses if you want to.

Of course! I can help you with that. It looks like your course is a fantastic introduction to some of the major schools of Indian Philosophy. Going through the topics systematically is the best way to prepare for your mid-semester exams and figure out what you might have missed.

Based on the materials provided, the course covers four major philosophical systems: **Cārvāka** (Indian Materialism), **Sāṅkhya**, **Yoga**, and **Advaita Vedānta**.

Let's break down the topics unit by unit. We'll start with the general foundations of Indian Philosophy and then dive into the first school, Cārvāka.

***

### **Part 1: Foundations and the Cārvāka School of Materialism**

This first part covers the basic framework for studying Indian philosophy and then examines the most radical of the schools, the materialist Cārvāka system.

#### **A. General Introduction to Indian Philosophy** (from File 02)

Before diving into specific schools, your professor laid out the groundwork. Understanding these concepts is key, as they provide the context for everything else.

* **The Human Quest and the Nature of Philosophy**: Philosophy isn't just a theoretical exercise; it's a practical guide for life that addresses fundamental questions.
  * What is the real nature of man? (e.g., body, soul, consciousness)
  * What is the goal of life? (This introduces the four *puruṣārthas*: Dharma, Artha, Kāma, and **Mokṣa**).
  * What is the nature of the universe? (e.g., real, illusion, material).
  * Is there a creator?
* **Branches of Philosophy**: You should know the basic divisions of philosophical inquiry.
  * **Metaphysics**: The study of ultimate reality.
  * **Epistemology**: The theory of knowledge (how we know what we know).
  * **Ethics**: The study of moral values.
  * **Logic**: The study of valid reasoning.
* **Classification of Indian Philosophical Schools**: This is a crucial distinction.
  * **Āstika (Orthodox)**: Schools that accept the authority of the Vedas. This includes the six classical systems (**Ṣaḍdarśana**): Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, **Sāṅkhya**, **Yoga**, Mīmāṃsā, and **Vedānta**.
  * **Nāstika (Heterodox)**: Schools that reject the authority of the Vedas. This includes **Cārvāka**, Buddhism, and Jainism.
* **Common Characteristics of Indian Philosophy**: Despite their differences, most Indian schools (with Cārvāka being a major exception) share these themes.
  * **Practical Orientation**: The goal is not just to know the truth, but to live it and achieve liberation.
  * **The Law of Karma**: The principle of moral causation where every action has consequences.
  * **Liberation (Mokṣa)**: The ultimate goal is freedom from the cycle of birth and death (*saṃsāra*).
  * **The Path to Liberation**: The path involves self-control, meditation, and overcoming ignorance (*avidyā*) through true knowledge (*jñāna*).

***

#### **B. The Cārvāka School (Lokāyata)** (from Files 01, 03)

The Cārvāka school is the first specific system covered. It stands apart from all other Indian philosophies because of its thoroughgoing materialism and skepticism.

* **Introduction and Background**:
  * It is considered a very old, pre-Buddhistic school.
  * The traditional founder is believed to be **Bṛhaspati**.
  * It is also known as **Lokāyata**, meaning "prevalent among the people" or "worldly."
  * It arose as a protest against the ritualism and idealism of the time.

* **Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge)**: This is the foundation of their entire philosophy.
  * **Perception (Pratyakṣa) is the ONLY valid source of knowledge (pramāṇa)**. Anything that cannot be perceived through the senses is considered non-existent or unknowable.
  * **Rejection of Inference (Anumāna)**: This is a key Cārvāka argument. They believe inference is a "leap in the dark."
    * The main reason is that inference depends on a universal, invariable relationship (**vyāpti**), like "wherever there is smoke, there is fire."
    * The Cārvākas argue that we can never perceive all instances of smoke and fire to be 100% certain of this universal rule. Therefore, *vyāpti* cannot be proven.
  * **Rejection of Testimony (Śabda)**: They reject the authority of scriptures like the Vedas because their claims (heaven, soul, etc.) cannot be perceived and are therefore invalid.

* **Metaphysics (Theory of Reality)**: Their epistemology directly leads to their metaphysics.
  * **Four Elements**: Only four elements are real because they are perceivable: **Earth, Water, Fire, and Air**. They reject the fifth, Ether (Ākāśa), because it cannot be perceived.
  * **Consciousness is a By-product of Matter**: The mind or soul is not a separate entity. Consciousness emerges from a specific combination of the four elements in the body, just as the intoxicating quality arises from fermented yeast or the red color emerges from combining betel nut and lime.
  * **The Soul is the Conscious Body**: There is no soul (*ātman*) that survives death. The self is simply the living, conscious body.
  * **Rejection of God, Afterlife, and Karma**: Since these cannot be perceived, the Cārvākas deny their existence.

* **Ethics (Theory of Life's Goal)**:
  * **Enjoyment (Kāma) is the only goal of human life**.
  * The philosophy is often summarized as "eat, drink, and be merry." The main advice is to seek the maximum amount of pleasure in this life, as it is the only one we have.
  * **Death is the only liberation (Mokṣa)**. There is no rebirth.

This covers the first major section of your course. Take some time to review these foundational concepts and the Cārvāka school. Once you're comfortable, we can move on to the next major topic: the intricate and highly influential **Sāṅkhya** philosophy. Let me know when you're ready!

***

### **Part 2: The Sāṅkhya Philosophy**

Now we move to one of the most important orthodox (Āstika) systems: **Sāṅkhya**. This school provides the metaphysical foundation for Yoga philosophy. It is a system of **dualistic realism**, meaning it posits two ultimate, independent realities. The material for this is spread across several files (04, 05, 06, 07, 08).

* **Introduction**:
  * **Founder**: The ancient sage **Kapila**.
  * **Meaning**: The word "Sāṅkhya" can mean 'enumeration' (as it enumerates 25 ultimate principles) or 'right knowledge'.
  * **Key Idea**: Sāṅkhya is an uncompromising dualism between **Puruṣa** (Consciousness/Spirit) and **Prakṛti** (Matter/Nature). It is also atheistic in its classical form.

#### **A. Theory of Causation: Satkāryavāda** (from Files 04, 08)

This is the cornerstone of Sāṅkhya metaphysics. The entire philosophy rests on its theory of how effects relate to their causes.

* **The Central Question**: Does the effect exist in its material cause *before* it is produced?
* **Asatkāryavāda (The Opponent's View)**: This theory, held by schools like Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika, argues that the effect (*kārya*) is non-existent (*asat*) before its creation. It is a completely new beginning (*ārambhavāda*). If the pot already existed in the clay, the potter's work would be pointless.
* **Satkāryavāda (The Sāṅkhya View)**: Sāṅkhya argues that the effect (*kārya*) pre-exists (*sat*) in its material cause in a latent or potential form. Production is not a new creation but merely a **manifestation** of what was already implicit. Destruction is simply the effect returning to its unmanifest state.
* **Five Arguments for Satkāryavāda**: You should know these key proofs.
    1. **`asadakaranāt`**: Something that does not exist (like a hare's horn) cannot be brought into existence. The effect must exist in the cause to be produced.
    2. **`upādānagrahaṇāt`**: The effect is invariably connected to its material cause. A pot can only be made from clay, not milk, showing a pre-existing relationship.
    3. **`sarvasambhavābhāvāt`**: Everything cannot be produced out of everything. This implies the effect is potentially contained within a specific cause.
    4. **`śaktasya śakya-karaṇāt`**: A cause can only produce an effect for which it has the potency or power. This potency implies the effect's potential existence.
    5. **`kāraṇabhāvāt`**: The effect is essentially the same as the cause; it is just a different form. The cloth is not fundamentally different from the threads.
* **Sub-theories of Satkāryavāda**:
  * **Pariṇāmavāda (Sāṅkhya's view)**: The effect is a **real transformation** of the cause (e.g., milk turning into curd).
  * **Vivartavāda (Vedānta's view)**: The effect is an **apparent or illusory transformation** of the cause (e.g., a rope appearing as a snake).

#### **B. The Two Ultimate Realities**

##### **1. Prakṛti (Primordial Matter)** (from Files 05, 08)

* **Nature of Prakṛti**: It is the single, uncaused, eternal, and unconscious root-cause of the entire physical universe, including our minds, egos, and intellects. It is also called Pradhāna (the first principle) or Avyakta (the unmanifest).
* **The Three Guṇas**: Prakṛti is not a simple substance. It is the state of perfect equilibrium of three constituent elements or forces called **guṇas**.
  * **Sattva**: The principle of lightness, illumination, harmony, and pleasure. Its color is white.
  * **Rajas**: The principle of activity, motion, dynamism, and pain. Its color is red.
  * **Tamas**: The principle of inertia, heaviness, obstruction, and indifference. Its color is dark.
  * These three are always present together, in conflict and cooperation, like the oil, wick, and flame of a lamp. The character of any object or person is determined by which guṇa is predominant.

##### **2. Puruṣa (Pure Consciousness)** (from Files 06, 08)

* **Nature of Puruṣa**: This is the principle of pure, transcendental consciousness. It is the self, the spirit, the ultimate knower or subject.
  * Puruṣa is a **witness** (*sākṣī*). It is inactive (*akartā*), indifferent (*udāsīna*), and beyond the three guṇas.
  * Consciousness is its very essence, not a quality. It is self-luminous and self-proven.
* **Arguments for the Existence of Puruṣa**: Sāṅkhya gives several proofs.
    1. **Teleological Proof**: The complex, non-intelligent world of Prakṛti must exist for the sake of an intelligent enjoyer (Puruṣa).
    2. **Logical Proof**: All objects are composed of the three guṇas, which implies the existence of a neutral witness that is beyond them.
    3. **Ethical Proof**: Prakṛti is the "enjoyed," so there must be an "enjoyer."
    4. **Mystical Proof**: The desire for liberation (*kaivalya*) implies the existence of someone who can be liberated.
* **Plurality of Puruṣas**: Unlike Vedānta, Sāṅkhya believes there are **many** Puruṣas, not one. The arguments for this are:
  * Differences in birth, death, and experiences. If there were only one Puruṣa, everyone would be born, die, and feel pleasure or pain at the same time.
  * Differences in spiritual status. Some souls are bound, some are liberated. If the self were one, the liberation of one would mean the liberation of all.

#### **C. Theory of Evolution** (from Files 07, 08)

* **How Evolution Begins**: Evolution (*sarga*) is the process of the manifest world emerging from the unmanifest Prakṛti. It starts when the equilibrium of the three guṇas is disturbed.
  * This disturbance is caused by the **proximity of Puruṣa to Prakṛti**. This union is compared to that of a **lame man (Puruṣa, who can see but not move) and a blind man (Prakṛti, who can move but not see)**. Together, they can reach their destination.
  * This union is a major philosophical problem for Sāṅkhya. How can two completely independent and opposite realities interact? The system struggles to provide a satisfactory answer.
* **The 23 Evolutes**: The process of evolution unfolds in a specific sequence, producing 23 principles or categories (*tattvas*).
    1. From Prakṛti emerges **Mahat** (the Great One), whose psychological aspect is **Buddhi** (intellect).
    2. From Mahat emerges **Ahaṅkāra** (the Ego or principle of individuation).
    3. Ahaṅkāra differentiates based on the dominant guṇa:
        * From **Sāttvika Ahaṅkāra** (Sattva dominant) emerge:
            * **Manas** (the mind)
            * The five sensory organs (*jñānendriyas*)
            * The five motor organs (*karmendriyas*)
        * From **Tāmasa Ahaṅkāra** (Tamas dominant) emerge:
            * The five subtle elements (*tanmātras*: sound, touch, form, taste, smell)
    4. From the five subtle elements (*tanmātras*) emerge the five gross elements (*mahābhūtas*: ether, air, fire, water, earth).
* **Teleological Nature**: Evolution is not random; it is purposive. It occurs for the sake of the Puruṣa, providing it with experience (*bhoga*) and ultimately leading to its liberation (*apavarga*).

#### **D. Bondage and Liberation (Kaivalya)** (from File 08)

* **Bondage**: The earthly life is full of suffering. Bondage is caused by **ignorance** (*avidyā*), which is the failure to discriminate between Puruṣa and Prakṛti. The Puruṣa mistakenly identifies itself with the products of Prakṛti (like the ego, mind, and body) and thus feels their pain and limitations.
* **Liberation**: Liberation is achieved not through actions (*karma*), but through **discriminative knowledge** (*jñāna*). When the Puruṣa realizes "I am not the body, I am not the mind, I am pure consciousness," it attains freedom.
* **The Nature of Kaivalya**: Liberation in Sāṅkhya is a state of **absolute isolation** (*kaivalya*) for the Puruṣa. It is a return to its true nature as a pure, indifferent witness. It is the complete cessation of the three kinds of pain, but it is **not** a state of positive bliss or joy (since pleasure is a product of the sattva guṇa, and the liberated Puruṣa is beyond all guṇas).

This covers the Sāṅkhya school in detail. It's a complex system, so make sure you are clear on the theory of causation (Satkāryavāda), the dualism of Puruṣa and Prakṛti, and the sequence of evolution. When you're ready, we'll look at how the **Yoga** school takes this Sāṅkhya metaphysics and turns it into a practical path.

***

### **Part 3: The Yoga Philosophy**

The Yoga school, founded by the sage **Patañjali**, is the practical application of Sāṅkhya philosophy. It is often called "Theistic Sāṅkhya" because while it accepts Sāṅkhya's metaphysics almost entirely, it introduces the concept of God (Īśvara). The materials for this section are in Files 09, 10, 11, and 12.

* **Introduction**:
  * **Founder**: **Patañjali**. His foundational text is the *Yoga Sūtras*.
  * **Meaning of Yoga**: In this context, Yoga does not mean 'union'. Patañjali defines it as **"the cessation of the modifications of the mind"** (*cittavṛttinirodha*).
  * **Relationship to Sāṅkhya**: Yoga accepts Sāṅkhya's 25 principles (Prakṛti, Puruṣa, and its evolutes) but adds God as the 26th principle. It provides the practical method for achieving the liberation (*kaivalya*) that Sāṅkhya describes theoretically.

#### **A. Yoga Psychology: The Nature of the Mind (Citta)** (from Files 09, 12)

Yoga provides a deep analysis of the human mind, which it calls **Citta**.

* **What is Citta?**: Citta is the mind-stuff, the first evolute of Prakṛti. It is composed of the three internal organs from Sāṅkhya: **Buddhi** (intellect), **Ahaṅkāra** (ego), and **Manas** (mind). Because it has a predominance of *sattva*, it is clear and capable of reflecting the pure consciousness of the Puruṣa, thus appearing conscious itself.
* **The Five Modifications of the Mind (Citta-Vṛttis)**: All mental activity falls into one of these five categories. The goal of yoga is to stop these fluctuations.
    1. **Pramāṇa**: Right Knowledge (from perception, inference, or testimony).
    2. **Viparyaya**: Wrong Knowledge (illusion or error, e.g., seeing a rope as a snake).
    3. **Vikalpa**: Verbal Delusion or Imagination (ideas that have no corresponding reality, like "a hare's horn").
    4. **Nidrā**: Deep Sleep. Yoga considers this a mental state, not an absence of one, because upon waking, one remembers having slept peacefully.
    5. **Smṛti**: Memory (the recollection of past experiences).
* **The Five Afflictions (Kleśas)**: These are the deep-seated psychological causes of all our suffering, rooted in ignorance.
    1. **Avidyā**: Ignorance; the fundamental error of seeing the non-eternal as eternal, the impure as pure, and the not-self as the self.
    2. **Asmitā**: Egoism; the false identification of the Puruṣa with the Citta (mind/intellect).
    3. **Rāga**: Attachment or craving for pleasant things.
    4. **Dveṣa**: Aversion or hatred for painful things.
    5. **Abhiniveśa**: Clinging to life or the instinctive fear of death.

#### **B. The Path of Yoga: Practice and States of Consciousness** (from File 10)

* **The Five Levels of the Mind (Cittabhūmi)**: The mind can exist in five states, depending on the dominance of the guṇas. Only the last two are conducive to Yoga.
    1. **Kṣipta** (Restless): Dominated by *rajas*, the mind jumps from one object to another.
    2. **Mūḍha** (Torpid/Dull): Dominated by *tamas*, leading to ignorance and sleep.
    3. **Vikṣipta** (Distracted): A mix of *sattva* and *rajas*, where the mind can focus temporarily but is easily distracted.
    4. **Ekāgra** (One-Pointed): Dominated by *sattva*. The mind achieves prolonged concentration on a single object. This is the beginning of true yoga.
    5. **Niruddha** (Restrained): All mental modifications are completely stopped. The mind is perfectly still.
* **The Two Kinds of Samādhi (Concentration)**: *Samādhi* is the state of deep meditative absorption.
  * **Samprajñāta Samādhi**: This corresponds to the *Ekāgra* state. It is concentration *with* an object of contemplation. The mind is fully absorbed in the object. It has four stages, moving from gross to subtle objects:
        1. **Savitarka**: Concentration on a gross physical object.
        2. **Savicāra**: Concentration on the subtle elements (*tanmātras*).
        3. **Sānanda**: Concentration on even subtler objects like the senses, leading to a state of bliss.
        4. **Sāsmitā**: Concentration on the ego-substance itself, realizing the self is distinct from it.
  * **Asamprajñāta Samādhi**: This corresponds to the *Niruddha* state. It is objectless concentration. All mental functions cease, and the Puruṣa abides in its true nature, completely isolated from Prakṛti. This is the final goal.

#### **C. The Eightfold Path of Yoga (Aṣṭāṅga Yoga)** (from File 11)

Patañjali outlines a systematic, eight-limbed path to prepare the body and mind for the final state of *Niruddha*.

* **External Aids (Bahiranga Sādhana)**
    1. **Yama** (Ethical Restraints): The five universal moral vows.
        * *Ahiṁsā* (non-violence), *Satya* (truthfulness), *Asteya* (non-stealing), *Brahmacharya* (continence/control of senses), *Aparigraha* (non-possessiveness).
    2. **Niyama** (Personal Observances): The five habits for self-purification.
        * *Śauca* (purity, external and internal), *Santoṣa* (contentment), *Tapas* (austerity), *Svādhyāya* (self-study of scriptures), *Īśvarapraṇidhāna* (devotion/surrender to God).
    3. **Āsana** (Posture): A steady and comfortable physical posture to prevent the body from being a distraction.
    4. **Prāṇāyāma** (Breath Control): Regulation of the breath, which helps steady the mind. It includes *Pūraka* (inhalation), *Kumbhaka* (retention), and *Recchaka* (exhalation).
    5. **Pratyāhāra** (Withdrawal of the Senses): Training the senses to turn inward, away from external objects, and follow the mind.
* **Internal Aids (Antaranga Sādhana)**
    6.  **Dhāraṇā** (Concentration): Fixing the mind's attention on a single point or object.
    7.  **Dhyāna** (Meditation): The uninterrupted, steady flow of thought around the object of concentration.
    8.  **Samādhi** (Absorption): The final stage, where the mind becomes so absorbed in the object that it loses its own identity. The distinction between the meditator, the act of meditation, and the object of meditation dissolves.

This structured eightfold path is designed to systematically purify and quiet the mind, making it capable of achieving the profound stillness required for liberation.

This covers the Yoga school. The key takeaway is how it builds a practical, psychological, and theistic framework upon the metaphysical foundation laid by Sāṅkhya. For the exam, be sure you can explain the goal of Yoga (*cittavṛttinirodha*), the five *vṛttis*, the five *kleśas*, and the eight limbs of the path.

When you feel ready, we'll tackle the final topic: **Śaṅkara's Advaita Vedānta**.

***

### **Part 4: Śaṅkara's Advaita Vedānta**

The final topic covered in your materials is **Advaita Vedānta**, as taught by the philosopher **Ādi Śaṅkara**. This is a system of **unqualified monism**, which stands in stark contrast to the dualism of Sāṅkhya-Yoga. It argues that there is only one, single, ultimate reality: **Brahman**. This section is based on File 13.

* **Core Doctrine**: The philosophy can be famously summarized in a single phrase:
  * ***Brahma satyam, jagat mithyā, jīvo brahmaiva nāparaḥ***
  * "Brahman is the only reality, the world is an illusory appearance, and the individual self (Jīva) is nothing but Brahman."

#### **A. Metaphysics: The Nature of Reality**

* **Brahman**: The one, absolute, ultimate reality. It is described as **Sat-Cit-Ānanda** (Pure Existence, Pure Consciousness, Pure Bliss). It is infinite, eternal, unchanging, and without attributes (*nirguṇa*).
* **The World (Jagat)**: The world of names and forms that we experience is not ultimately real in the way Brahman is. It is **Mithyā**.
  * **Mithyā** does not mean completely non-existent (like a hare's horn). It means it has a **dependent or illusory reality**. It is an appearance.
  * The classic analogy is the **rope and the snake**. In dim light, a rope is mistaken for a snake. The snake is not real, but it is also not nothing—it is an appearance superimposed on the reality of the rope. Similarly, the world is an appearance superimposed on the reality of Brahman.
* **Māyā / Avidyā (Illusion / Ignorance)**: This is the inexplicable power of Brahman that makes the one, unchanging reality appear as the diverse, changing world. It is the cosmic principle of illusion. At the individual level, it is called **Avidyā** (ignorance), which is what keeps us from realizing our true nature.

#### **B. The Self: Ātman and Jīva**

* **Ātman (The True Self)**: The true self, the pure consciousness that is the witness within each person, is in reality identical to Brahman. It is eternal, infinite, and unchanging.
* **Jīva (The Individual Soul/Ego)**: The *jīva* is the individual, finite self that we experience ourselves to be ("I am tall," "I am happy," "I am a student"). This is not the true self. The *jīva* is the Ātman that, due to ignorance (*avidyā*), has mistakenly identified itself with the limitations of the body and mind (*antahkaraṇa*).
* **The Body**: Śaṅkara distinguishes between:
  * **The Gross Body**: The physical body that we perceive, which perishes at death.
  * **The Subtle Body**: Composed of the senses, motor organs, vital energies, and the mind. This body does not perish at death but migrates with the soul to its next life.
* **"That Thou Art" (Tat Tvam Asi)**: This is one of the great declarations (*mahāvākyas*) of the Upaniṣads. Śaṅkara explains that this statement proclaims the absolute identity between the individual self (Thou) and the ultimate reality (That/Brahman). The identity is not between the limited ego and God, but between the underlying pure consciousness in both.

#### **C. Analysis of the Three States of Consciousness**

Śaṅkara uses an analysis of our daily experience of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep to point toward the nature of the true self (Ātman).

1. **Waking State**: The self identifies with the gross body and the mind, experiencing the external world through the senses.
2. **Dreaming State**: The self is detached from the gross body but still identifies with a mind that creates and experiences a dream world. The feeling of being a limited subject persists.
3. **Deep, Dreamless Sleep State**: In this state, there are no objects, no thoughts, and no sense of "I." The subject-object duality vanishes. However, consciousness does not cease, because upon waking, we remember, "I slept peacefully and knew nothing." This shows that the Ātman exists as a pure, objectless consciousness—a silent witness—even when the mind is dormant. This state gives us a glimpse of our true nature, free from limitations.

#### **D. Bondage and Liberation (Mokṣa)**

* **Bondage**: Bondage is not real; it is an illusion caused by **ignorance (Avidyā)**. It is the erroneous belief that "I am this limited body and mind," which leads to suffering, desire, and the cycle of rebirth (*saṃsāra*).
* **Liberation**: Since bondage is caused by ignorance, it can only be removed by **knowledge (Jñāna)**. Liberation is the direct, intuitive realization of the truth that "I am Brahman" (*Aham Brahmāsmi*). It is not about *becoming* Brahman, but about *realizing* that one has always been Brahman.
* **The Nature of Liberation**: It is the complete dissolution of the illusion of being a separate individual and the attainment of a state of infinite existence, consciousness, and bliss (Sat-Cit-Ānanda).

***

This concludes the overview of the topics from your course materials.

**To summarize your mid-semester syllabus:**

1. **Introduction to Indian Philosophy**: Key concepts, classification of schools (Āstika/Nāstika), and common themes like Karma and Mokṣa.
2. **Cārvāka Philosophy**: Materialism, perception as the only source of knowledge, and rejection of soul, God, and afterlife.
3. **Sāṅkhya Philosophy**: Dualistic realism (Puruṣa/Prakṛti), theory of causation (Satkāryavāda), the three guṇas, and the theory of evolution.
4. **Yoga Philosophy**: The practical path based on Sāṅkhya, the goal of stopping mental modifications (*cittavṛttinirodha*), and the eightfold path (*aṣṭāṅga yoga*).
5. **Advaita Vedānta**: Monism (Brahman is the only reality), the world as an illusion (*mithyā*), and the identity of the individual self (Ātman) with Brahman.

My advice for your preparation would be to focus on the core distinctions between these schools, especially in their metaphysics (what is ultimately real?) and epistemology (how do we know?). Good luck with your exams
