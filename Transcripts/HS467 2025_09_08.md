So today we will start with Adeta Vedanta.
Since I told you guys that if you want to, you have gone through Samstha, no need of Vedanta.
I take what I don't know.
But people, they give much importance to Vedanta, especially the Adeta Vedanta.
Okay.
So today we will start Adeta Vedanta.
Maybe before the exam, we can finish at least the concept of the self.
So today we are going to discuss what you are, what we all are.
I have started my class in the beginning when I did this Dharma course, what Aditya Vedanta says, in one verse.
The whole philosophy can be understood in one verse.
Brahman Satya Jagad Mithya Jive Brahman Napa.
Now let us see today we discuss, first let us know what we are.
If I ask you, who are you?
You can answer the questions by telling your name, or something, I am from so and so department, or I am from so and so place.
But let us discuss today what we are.
What are you?
As I said, Gautama Buddha was asked by the same leopard boy.
When he got bodhisattva, prajna, knowledge, coming out of the samadhi, then the first person, first boy met him.
He was a shepherd boy.
Then he asked him the question, what are you?
He did not ask, who are you?
He asked, what are you?
Are you an angel?
Buddha said, no.
Are you God?
Buddha said, no.
Then what are you?
So Gautama Buddha answered,
I am the awakening Buddha.
Okay?
So I will come back to Buddhism later.
Today we will discuss about this awakening Buddha, that consciousness, that self.
Of course Buddha said, talked about not-self.
Today we will discuss about the self.
Today we will discuss about what you all are.
What we all are.
Let us see what that is.
To whom the Sarvaka denied.
What Sarvaka said?
Consciousness is the by-product of matter.
Today we will start with the Aditya Vedanta concept of Atman.
Before that let us discuss this.
This discussion was known in many places.
I will start with the Bhagavad Gita.
If you think of when one comes directly to the Gita, the concept of self,
However, it becomes evident that very fast doctrinal instruction Krishna gives to Arjuna is not about the devotion, duty, action, but about the Atman.
Many people say Gita talks about action, karma, bhakti, jnana, all this yoga is there.
But if you really think, unless until you know what you are, how can I go for knowledge, bhakti or devotion or whatever other yogas are there?
So it's about the Atman.
Once Sri Krishna is in the battlefield.
I am talking about in the battlefield.
Gita was in the battlefield.
When Sri Arjuna says, I cannot kill my near and dear ones.
I cannot kill my teachers.
I cannot kill my brothers and sisters, my dear ones.
So he started lamenting.
He was breaking down.
how you want to do actions whether you are the doer of actions
or this body-mind organ.
So instead of going for this knowledge path, let us start with the Atman, what Vipassana talks to Arjuna.
Then, this Gita is nothing but a portion of Adeta Vedanta.
This is significant because the teaching of the Atman represents not merely the opening of Krishna's doctrine but also the foundational doctrine of Vedanta itself.
The way Krishna starts giving
The teachings to the Arjuna.
It is nothing but the foundational teaching of the Vedanta itself.
It is the Vedanta.
Thus, while the Gita may forge unique emphasis, its central philosophy emerges, aligned similarly with that of Vedanta, the realization of the self as immortal, indescribable, and eternal.
So it is the same Vedanta.
The doctrine of Atman, the self, is the starting point of Krishna's teaching in the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita.
The doctrine of self, what the self is.
When Vajrashtra says, I cannot kill my dear ones, I cannot kill my teachers.
All these things are going to happen.
Then Sri Krishna started teaching him what the self is.
After Arjuna lays before this despair, Krishna immediately shifts the discourse to the true nature of the self, thereby grounding the entire dialogue in the Vedantic traditions.
If you think of once he said that I cannot kill, I cannot fight with all these things, let me go out, I don't need anything.
If the Kauravas are going to take up everything, let them take, but I cannot do these illegal things, unethical things.
This questioner taught me the concept of
self, what exactly the self is.
And that concept of self is nothing but the teaching of Atman or the Vedanta.
Now Atman is not the personality or not the body, not the mind or not the essential reality of underlying self.
What this Atman is, just I will stop it and go to the Vedanta.
We will discuss about it later.
So what this Atman is,
It is not the body, not the mind, not the brain system, not the sense organs.
But it is what?
Let us see.
We have discussed many times.
We have discussed many times that it is not the body, not the mind, not the sense organs.
It is what?
Then what this Atman is?
What this consciousness do you identify with yourself?
Today we discussed with that.
What exactly we are?
Let us know.
We know that we always identified ourselves with the body-mind academy.
And we say I am so and so.
This is mind.
Everything was discussed in the Chantiyas.
If it's not the body, if it's not the mind, then what it is?
What's the nature?
What is the material?
What do you, can you sense what exactly it is?
What is that material?
To whom you said this is the same as the I am, I. What that material is?
It is your being or self or existence itself.
Atman is the existence or the self.
I have already discussed, I am cutting with that point, that this concept of self, because all of you are our existence, you cannot deny, that we discussed long, long, in many classes, that you cannot deny your existence.
What this atman is?
Sir, I cannot deny myself.
Very denial itself is going to prove that you exist.
Am I right?
This discussion we did.
Then what exactly that existence is?
Here, the Aditya Vedanta says, This Jiva, this Atman is no way different from Brahman.
This Atman is the Sat.
Satya means Sat, existence, real.
Am I right?
This Atman is Sat, Sat means existence, and real.
What that real is?
Today we will discuss what we are.
If the soul or Atman is existence, if your nature is existence itself, if it is short, then if it is short and existence, that means what?
It is other than you.
I have given you that example many times.
When you say, I know it, subject-object duality, we have discussed many classes.
Self and the knowing.
There are two things.
Am I right?
Subject, object.
I know the blackboard.
You are not the blackboard.
You said I know that the blackboard.
You know the blackboard.
The blackboard and you are different or not?
The blackboard is the object.
You are the subject.
You know the blackboard.
So now, this subject is nothing but the pure consciousness, Atman or Brahman, whatever.
Brahman we will discuss later.
This is the Atman.
Now, the moment you say this Atman exists, I know it exists.
I know I exist.
You know you exist, no?
Am I right?
You cannot deny that, no?
The moment you say its existence, that means you know.
That becomes, try to understand the logic.
If you don't understand the logic, you cannot go ahead.
The moment you say it is self,
Atman is sat or satya or existence, pure consciousness, whatever you are.
If it's existence, that means what?
You know its existence?
This existence is different from other than you know?
Because the moment you know its existence, it exists.
The table exists.
Means what?
This is an object which exists, which I know.
Okay?
This is the point.
Try to find out the... Let us discuss about the logic behind it.
Mahatma Gandhi said that existence is short.
If the soul or Atman is existence and your nature is existence itself, it is short, then something other than you.
Am I right?
If it is existence, it's other than you.
Okay.
Now let us accept each other than you.
Because the moment you say table exists, the table is different, you are the different.
A table exists.
Now, something other than you, something which is different from you, which is not at all.
If it is something other than you, if you say existence, it's other than you.
If you say, sir, I know the color of the blackboard is green.
That means what?
You know the color of the blackboard is green.
Is it different than you?
You know, you is different and knowing is different.
The moment you say, Atman is sir, the existence.
That means what?
Existence is other than you.
Just for the timing, you have the patience and accept, yes, the existence is other than you.
So now, then it is what happens?
The moment you say this, that different from the self or not self, different from Atman, we call it un-Atman.
The moment very existence is to say other than you.
Exists any existence.
Is it other than you or not?
You exist, that is fine.
The table exists.
I am talking about the existence.
Existence of the self, the consciousness to whom you identify with the body.
Because we have already discussed this self is not the body, not the mind, not the sensory organs, other than that.
And what is that?
That is pure, short existence.
Again, the moment you say pure, short existence, means it is other than you.
Existence, the word existence itself, other than you.
Okay?
Now, Atman is existence itself, pure being.
The Atman, not the self, will be not being, not existence.
If you say it's other than you, then it's non-existence.
Am I right?
Try to understand my point.
I am talking about Atman is, it exists.
Anything exists, we know.
The moment we know, we know is different than the existence.
Knowing, you know, your subject which you know is different from other than you.
Similarly, if you say Atman is existence, this existence is different than you or not?
Existence is different you, it is different you.
It's non-existence.
Not existence.
Then how come Atman is pure existence, sub and kip and glip, whatever you want.
Okay now, Atman is existence itself, pure being.
The Atman, not the self, will be not being, non-existence.
Or in other words, you can say, if you are existence, then something apart from you will be non-existence.
If you say, it's existence.
Something is nothing but existence, Atman is nothing but existence.
Then here you are claiming that other than something which is non-existence.
Am I right?
If you say Atman is existence, then something is non-existence.
Because, so why it's non-existence?
You are existence itself.
How do we come to know that?
How do you come to know that you exist?
Try to understand.
I exist.
How do you know?
Because you never go out of the existence.
Am I right?
How do you know that you exist?
Because you never go out of the existence.
Am I right?
If I say there is an umbrella, you go and check whether outside there is an umbrella or not.
But similarly if you think of your existence, you don't go outside or out anywhere to see your existence.
That means what?
If I say there is an umbrella, go and check.
You go and check, yes, there is an umbrella.
But the moment you say you are existence itself, how do you come to know that?
You never go out of existence.
You never come into existence or never go out of existence.
You have to see.
That's what Sri Krishna is saying.
If that is true, in the case you are existence itself, something other than you, something other than the self will be of the nature of non-existence.
If you are existence other than you, what is existence?
Sat, no?
I am talking about that reality, Sat, consciousness.
Then other than you will be non-existence.
And this is what Krishna used to say to Arjuna in the 16th verse of Bhagavad Gita, where he says, That which is atman, which is your being, it never goes out of existence, it is always there.
And that which is not atman, which is not you, is not being itself.
That means, suppose if I talk about the existence of space in a pot.
Existence of space in a pot.
I am talking about a mud pot.
The space inside the pot.
The space... You are science student, you can understand it easily.
The space inside the pot.
Okay?
Now, that exists inside the pot.
You break the pot.
Do you think that the existence vanishes?
Or the existence destroyed?
The pot was destroyed.
The existence...
Of the space.
I am talking of the existence of the space inside the pot.
It exists or not?
Or it is destroyed?
It's a space.
That's all.
See, simple words you can understand.
If I say, the sky.
Now forget about physics.
If you are physics students, you can understand.
You can say, there is nothing called sky.
It's a space only.
But sometimes it becomes blue.
We write the beautiful poem, Blue Sky.
Sometimes it is dark, sometimes it is red.
What is this?
But in fact, it is space only, space only.
Do we think the sky is getting affected when it is blue?
Come back to the physics.
Why it is blue?
The sky is blue.
Space, vacuum, all of you know it's a simple physics.
The sky, it's space only.
Sometimes it becomes blue, sometimes it becomes red, sometimes it becomes dark, black.
Is there any color of the sky?
Is there any color of the sky?
There is no color.
Come back to your physics class.
Childhood physics.
Not our physics.
Our physics is full of mathematics and abstract.
You cannot understand.
Of course physics people can understand.
But we cannot understand it.
It's too abstract.
Too mathematical.
You will fail several times.
Too mathematical.
I am talking about the simple physics that the color of the sky.
You say, sir, the color of the sky is blue.
How come?
Okay.
After some time you say, sir, if I ask in the evening time, what is the color of the sky?
Sir, red.
Tell me what exactly the color of the sky is.
I am not asking you.
Morning you said blue, afternoon you said this, now you are saying this, in the evening you are saying it's dark.
What exactly the color of the sky is?
It is colorless.
Why should you read critics?
But we understand that, no?
Similarly, space inside the pot.
When I say space inside the pot, you break the pot.
You have broken the pot.
Pot was broken, got into pieces and pieces.
Do you think that the space inside it got broken and became pieces and pieces and destroyed?
No, no use.
The space I am talking about inside the pot.
Now pot has no use.
It has come from the earthen jar or pot from earth, from clay.
And when you break it inside the pot, the space was there.
Now pot got broken, not the space.
The space is always there.
Existence.
Existence of the space is as it is.
Similarly, let us see our concept of self, what Krishna is teaching to the originals.
Okay?
So it never exists, that which is Atman, it is pure being, it never goes out of existence.
It's always there.
The way I said the space inside the pot.
You break the pot, the space is always there.
It does not have an existence, it's always there.
Similarly, and that which is Atman, which is not you, it's not being itself.
It never exists also, never comes to existence.
You, the Atman, you never go out of existence.
You are always, that Atman is always there.
And that which is not you, something other than the real you, never comes into existence.
which is not you, it never comes into existence.
Because you say you are the existence.
Now that is the question.
Let us see.
It never exists also, never comes into existence.
And you the Atman, you never go out of existence.
And that which is not you, something other than the real you, never comes into existence.
Atman
That Vedanta says, atman satya jagat mithya.
Okay?
You are the only reality.
Existence.
Exist.
Which is self.
Which is existence.
And you the self, the pure being, you are the reality.
That is called atman.
You are there.
And you are real nature.
And your nature is not a person.
Not the body.
Not the mind.
Not the sense organs.
And everything apart from you, whatever you think is not me, is actually an appearance, it's not real.
What other than you, what you see, because you said my existence, I proved the existence of the self, no?
It is always there.
The way the space inside the earthen jar.
You break the jar, the space is there.
Jar got broken.
This body got broken.
This sensor lens has gone.
But I am talking about the pure self or the existence of the self or consciousness.
So now, what?
Atman satya jagat mithya.
Atman, nothing but the pure consciousness, or the self, to whom you identify yourself with the body, mind, and organizing.
It's not the body, it's not the mind, it's not the sensor guns, it's other than that.
which exists, and which exists forever.
Though we have said that the space exists, even if the space exists in our glass, the space exists in the pot, the space inside, I am talking about the inside.
You break everything, still the pot exists.
Sorry, still the space exists.
You cannot say that space vanishes.
Space exists.
It's space.
The earthen jar got broken.
The cup got broken.
The glass got broken.
Inside the glass, the space is there.
It's always there.
Similarly, the self is.
And it does not come into existence yet we experience how it is possible.
Now, and everything apart from you, whatever you think is not me is actually an appearance.
It's not real.
Now, let us see whether it is true.
In front of me, everything is real.
This table is real, chair is real.
Then how come these people are saying that all these things are unreal other than you?
So, now to this we can ask the question, if it does not come into existence, yet we experience it, how it is possible?
If it does not exist us.
Now we prove that self exists.
Forever.
And what about other things?
Vedanta said appearance.
How come it's appearance?
We have experienced.
I experienced a bull.
I experienced a chair.
I am sitting in a wheelchair.
I am talking to you.
All these are real.
How come Vedanta says these are bad or unreal?
Are they God's map?
Okay, are you getting my point?
Jagat mithya.
What does mean by jagat mithya?
In front of me, everything is real.
I am reading, I am writing, I am a student, I am going to get a job, then life goes on.
How come these are the mithyas?
How come the real, I am the only real and remaining are mithyas?
In what sense is it mithya?
Now, if it does not come into existence yet, we experience it.
How is it possible?
Something does not come into existence yet, we experience it.
We experience everything.
So now we are experiencing it as another.
It borrows existence from you.
Now I will take another example.
Borrowing existence.
Now in a kettle or in a cooking vessel, you are boiling potato.
What you are boiling?
Potato.
Now potato was boiled with water in a kettle.
Now when potato was boiled, you touch the potato, it's hot or not?
It's hot.
But in fact, potato, when you think of a potato, is it hot?
A real potato.
It's not hot.
It borrows its hotness from the boiling water.
Am I right?
Are you getting my point?
When you boil a potato, the potato is hot.
Hotness of the potato.
is real, comes from potato only.
Because we have seen in real life, potato is not hot.
It borrows hotness from the hot water.
Now come back to the water.
Is the water always hot?
No.
It borrows its hotness from the pot.
Water is cool.
Water is as cool as frost.
It is not hot.
Its nature is not hot.
Okay.
Then what is this hotness of the water?
It borrows from the
Boiling pan, it borrows its hotness from the boiling pan.
Now let us see, is the boiling pan always hot?
Is it the intrinsic property of boiling pot always hot?
No, no.
Then where does it borrows?
It borrows from the fire.
Am I right?
So fire has the intrinsic quality of making hot.
And the remaining are extrinsic qualities.
All others are burrowing, burrowing, burrowing, burrowing.
That is not their real nature.
Potato is potato.
If you take a simple potato, your hand is not going to burn.
But if you take a boiling potato, your hand gets burned.
And the reality of potato is not hot.
It borrows its hotness from the boiling water.
Water is not hot.
It borrows the hotness from the boiling water.
Water, in fact, is not hot.
It borrows its hotness from the pot.
Pot is itself not hot.
It borrows from the fire.
Fire has intrinsic properties of heat.
Similarly, the whole world
When I say mithya, the whole world borrows its existence from the awareness, from the consciousness.
You are the only which is real.
Remaining earth borrows its existence from you.
Are you getting the point or not?
If you don't understand this, borrowing the hotness of the potato is not real.
It borrows its hotness from boiling water.
Water is also not really hot.
It borrows its hotness from the boiling pan.
Pan also does not have hotness, its real property.
It borrows from the fire.
Fire has the intrinsic property of heat.
Similarly, this consciousness, this self, has the intrinsic property of existence.
It exists.
It's short.
And remaining are false.
The way I said, fire is the intrinsic property of heat.
Remaining heat, you see, is our borrows.
for the time being.
Am I right?
Are you getting the example or understanding the example?
If you understand the example then you can understand the concept of the self where I am saying the only existence is nothing but the self in the context of intrinsic quality, real quality, in reality.
In reality you are the existence, you are the consciousness, pure consciousness and remaining are borrowed consciousness.
Remaining are projected in front of you, but you are not affected.
Okay?
So, did you catch the point?
I'll go ahead.
Okay, I said you exist.
Brahman, you, the existence, Atman exists and remaining is false in what sense?
The other's existence are borrowed from you.
So your existence, your consciousness is real or has intrinsic property.
You understand now what do you mean by intrinsic property?
So now if you say that just like the potato or the boiling water of the pan had borrowed heat from the fire,
Underneath, similarly, this world of names and forms, it borrows existence from the Atman or Brahman, from pure being.
See, this is the way the potato borrows its hotness from the boiling pan, from the fire.
Similar way, the existence of the world is borrowed from the existence of the self.
Your existence is real.
other than you, other than the self, all are borrowed consciousness, existence.
And only real is you, the pure consciousness, the self.
You understand?
If you understand the intrinsic property of the potato, heart, so you can understand what exactly you are.
You are the only real.
Okay?
And with that in the absence,
Now, Candice appears to have an existence.
All other things are appears, as if there appears as existence.
It appears to have an existence.
This appearing to have an existence apart from you, we don't feel that these things are borrowing existence from us.
We don't feel, generally in our daily life, do you feel they borrow the existence from you?
I convinced you that you are the pure consciousness.
