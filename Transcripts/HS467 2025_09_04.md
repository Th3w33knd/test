Many difficulties, many obstacles come in your life.
How to face?
How to tackle?
If you have this practice of yoga, at least this is going to help you in your breakdown during the difficult times of our life.
So today we will discuss about asana.
So there are various kinds of asana.
or discipline of body and consists in the adoption of steady and comfortable posture.
Assam is nothing but comfortable posture in which posture one can sit before touching the ego.
Whether it's pranayama or any kind of predications, you should sit in a proper way.
That is called Assam posture.
Otherwise, instead of making your body comfortable, making your body suitable, making your body perfect, you will arrive at imperfect in all that.
Because there are all these two steps which we discussed, that you have to follow at least.
But here, this is the technical side.
If you don't follow technically how to sit posture, then it would be difficult for you to perfect your body.
Otherwise, it may lead you to give you diseases.
or body may be like this figure.
So there are some asanas before doing pranayama or meditations or dhyana or dharana, whatever you say.
These asanas have to be followed perfectly.
Again, this is also under the guidance of some experts.
It's not that ordinarily you do it the way you do.
Once you learn the technique, you can see it for others.
So there are various kinds of asana.
How to show it?
There can be properly learned only under the guidance of experts.
The discipline of the body is as much as necessary for attainment of concentration at that of the mind.
If the body is not completely free from diseases and other disturbing influences, it is very difficult to attain concentration.
So body is most important.
It seems that Indian philosophers, they never say, though it was stated that body was neglected, body was oppressed, body was depressed.
No.
Because remember, body is nothing but this is the divine temple on which you are searching for the spirituality.
This body, unless and until your body is perfect, can you read, sit for an hour and read and get a good mark?
No.
First of all your body has to be sound, has to be perfect.
This body is everything.
We cannot neglect the body.
We need to think of the consciousness.
Consciousness is the platform on which this body is.
If the body is a diseased body,
then consciousness will vanish.
That's all.
So in order to... body is also equally important, the way mind is important.
Unless, until your body is perfect, make it imperfect, make it digitless, how it will be?
Then only you can think of your mind.
Suppose you are feeling feverish, or you are feeling headache or stomach ache, can you see for yourself or you cannot?
So your mind will not allow you, you will feel dull, you will feel pain.
So therefore body is also important, don't neglect.
The way other, if you think of the sadhus, they neglect the body, no.
This body is the divine temple on which we are talking for the spirituality.
We are doing everything because of the body.
Because you have a good body, perfect body, sound body, definitely your mind will be sound, your mind will be perfect.
Therefore we should not neglect the body.
We need some asanas to be practiced before sitting in the yoga sessions.
These asanas are Bhadrasana, Padmasana, Vibhasana.
There are many kinds of asanas.
And these asanas can be learnt through proper guidance of any yoga teacher.
how to sit, how to fold your legs in Padmasana or in Virasana.
There are many guides.
So in details we are not discussing.
We will discuss about pranayama today.
Which I want all of you to practice again under some guidance.
Just I am going to give you the theoretical knowledge and the practical knowledge generally we will get it from the yoga teacher.
For online also it is available.
Good teachers.
You may hate the other aspects or characters of the person, but if you think of the yoga, sometimes we feel Ramdev is the perfect teacher.
He used to give us teaching, which is available online, but don't go there.
If you go there, you have to spend a lot of rupees.
He had an ashram where
Lakh-lakh rupees, unless you have black money, you cannot take.
Some courses are like that.
But in IIT, we get yoga teachers every year.
There are our student friends.
There is a club.
They bring yoga teachers who come to IIT for a month or 15 days to teach yoga to campus residents as well as to the students.
But sometimes we are so neglected to our body and mind, we never think of the importance of yoga, though all the chances are there to learn yoga.
So after this, what happens?
Neither you will get the time nor you will get the mind to do yoga.
Still, when it is required, what you will do?
You will again search for internet or online teaching who gives yoga teaching and you take.
My point is that when IIT is providing, when you are a student, you have a lot of time with you.
So whenever the yoga camps happens in our IIT, please join.
I think it is clear because we don't pay for it also.
But once you are out, you have to pay a lot.
That time you will understand what is the importance of yoga.
Without that you cannot live.
So you have to pay.
Once you pay, then there is no time.
Time will be an aspect for your life.
So therefore today we will discuss about pranayama, how to do, what is pranayama,
Prana plus Ayam.
If you think of the Sanskrit term Pranayama, Prana plus Ayam.
It's called Pranayama.
Pranayama is nothing but the regulation of our breathing.
Then you can say, sir, what will happen if we regulate our breathing?
But there is a lot of scientific reason.
Now this was taken by, adopted by medical science as one of the instruments.
No medical instrument, they have taken it up.
Even if you go to our IIT hospital sometimes, of course not you, you are young.
I am talking about the old people or the residents of our IIT community.
They go for the, this is, doctor is to prescribe, you have to do this pranayama at least.
Some kind of yoga you have to do.
Surya Namaskar, how many of you do Surya Namaskar?
None of you do Surya Namaskar.
Now there is a technique how to do Surya Namaskar.
So my point is that when you are a student, you are a child, take it a course that you should do at least one or two kind of yoga every day.
If not, pranayama is very easy and the impact, the result of pranayama you will be able to do after one month.
How was your mind before that?
How was your mind after that?
How you can have the concentration on your body?
Anything you do.
Or sitting in the lab or anywhere you want to.
So this is nothing but controlling our regulation of our breath.
It consists in suspension of the breathing process either after exhalations or inhalations or simple retention of the vital breath.
The details of the process should be learned by the expert.
Yoga prescribes great control for concentration of the mind because it conduces to steadiness of the body and the mind.
So long as the functions of breathing continues, the mind also goes on functioning and noticing the current air in and out.
This phenomena is nothing but the controlling our breathing.
That technique one has to learn.
What happens when you take, you have to sit some asana, whether padma asana or simple asana, doesn't matter.
Or very asana, one asana, one posture, your posture, holding both of your legs, sit, closing your eyes, straightening your backbone, straight, then close one nostril, take the breathing in the other nostril, and while taking this,
There is a timing.
Follow that timing.
Either you can count 1 to 8 because there is a Kundalini which is just like a snake.
8, English 8.
There are two pineal glands from our head to the end of the backbone.
That nods, two nods.
They crosses in between and it's just like English 8.
So therefore the scientific science says that if you can count 8 while taking breathing in one of the nostrils and keep the breathing again in the same period of time.
That generally happens counting 8.
Some people they chant Om.
You know they are also, that is also possible if you have practiced that.
But for some people they say, why shall I chant Om?
I can do in other way round like counting eight.
Why eight?
Because the two nerves in our backbone, two nerves from the head, they process, they meet each other just like English head.
So we'll start how to do this pranayama.
So it is a set of physical exercise and at controlling the prana or the breath we take.
It consists of drawing, holding, and exhaling.
Pranayama has three real stages.
Uraka, called inhaling, when you take breathing in one of the nostrils, hold it in the other nostril.
And kumbhaka, holding the breath.
Kumbhaka means you have to hold the breath.
Exactly same time.
The time you take, while taking the breathing, same time you should keep it, hold it.
And
Again close the other nostril and leave it in the other nostril, again counting the same time, exact time.
That is the size.
That exhaling is called Richaka.
There are three things, Uraka, Kumbhaka and Richaka.
Or you can remember inhaling, holding exhaling.
Inhaling when you take and hold it the exact time.
then leave it in the other nostril again tapping or with even the same time so this helps of controlling breathing but it must turn redeeming regularity with chanting home or the as easier than merely counting increase mental concentration and consequently cures its various distractions or bhutis once you do it
Our target is to destroy, our target is to erase the vrutis.
Vrutis means modifications, which I have already discussed in the beginning.
What mind gets modified into.
How many kinds of modifications?
Five kinds of modifications.
Right knowledge, wrong knowledge, verbal knowledge, then suruti or memory, and sleep.
Okay?
So here, our target yoga is nothing but to erase all the mental modifications.
Mind has to have the concentration on the particular object.
Whatever you do.
That is the aim.
So now, while you do this pranam, how it happens?
Here, that happens when you take the breathing in one of the nostrils.
hold it, again leave in the other nostril.
So if you continuously do it, all the vrittis, during that time, the time you take, the time you hold, the time you leave, all other thoughts are not going to come to your mind.
You are arresting.
This way you can arrest all the thoughts.
So now, in this, rousing of Kundalini has a great significance.
The product of nerve currents in the body, namely pothos, is the distinctive factor between the different nerves.
These two great nerve centers of the body start from the brain, go down each side of the spinal cord.
If you think of it, you call it Kundalini.
It has to be aroused.
This Kundalini has to be aroused.
These two nerves which you see in our backbone, or backside of our head,
and these two great nerves center of the body starts from the brain it will start from the brain go down east side of the spinal cord where these two nerves meet it is just like English egg so now the moment you take breathing in one of the nostril see imagine that English egg it takes it goes with one of the nerve systems
and hold it, and when you are leaving, closing the other nostril, then other nose, this side, suppose you start with the left side, right side, then close the left side, take the breathings, hold it, and leave the breathing.
Once you do it, during that period, the two nerve systems, in one nerve system it goes, and in the other nerve system it comes out.
So if you do like this, then the arrest of the brutish or modification, here I have written brutish, always remember the modification if you have any difficulty of Sanskrit.
Our target is to arrest mental modifications.
by cross in the shape of figure 8 the back of our head.
So it crosses in our head just like English say.
Therefore sometimes it was recommended you count 8 while taking breathing in one of the nostril and leaving and hold also counting 8 and leave it in the other nostril.
So prana, so these regions are just fundamental processes.
So it starts with imagining Kundalini who is like Shiva, is like snake coiled on a triangular boat.
So this angle says just like a snake.
Imagine it just like a snake, it is coiled and it is starting from our backbone, sorry head, and it goes to the
backbone of our bodasana.
So now the first step is to inhale air through one of the nostrils while counting eight and holding eight.
Once you take in one of the nostrils counting eight, hold it again counting eight and exhale in through other nostrils while again counting eight.
During the holding one has to imagine it's travel down the figure eight or the kundalini.
When you are holding it, you have to imagine, close your eyes.
At that moment, we close our eyes.
Why do we close our eyes when we go to God, temple, or do pranayama?
Have you thought of?
If you want to go to God, you have to say, when you say namaste to me, you open your eyes and say, sir, namaste.
But when you go to the temple, what do we do?
We close our eyes, then do pranayama.
So if you think of the scientific reason, I understand, I don't know how you understand.
Some scientific reason is that the God to whom we are searching is within.
not in front of you i may be in front of you but the god you are searching in the temple in the church in the mosque or in the gurudwara it is there it's with you what is therefore you close your eyes and say namaste similarly here what happens you have to imagine when you keep holding the the breathing in one of the natural images it's the kundalini just like english
And the breathing passes.
If you do, you cannot do for five minutes in the beginning.
Don't do.
You'll feel tired.
You'll feel that, sir did something, I'm getting very tired.
In fact, you'll get tired for five minutes.
Start with one minute.
Every day one minute.
One week.
Then after you can increase for two minutes, three minutes, four minutes.
Sometimes it goes to half an hour.
After that you can see how your body will be relaxed.
And you will not have disease at all.
You can say, sir, this is like some diseases are, doctor says, hereditary.
For example, cholesterol, triglycerides.
See, everything is nothing but all the diseases comes up when you are tense, out of tension.
But if you do this thing, you will not have disease at all.
What comes in old age, leave it.
But I am talking about young age, the way you are popular right now.
The young face, young mind, young laugh, that should continue at least till you are retired from your job, be at home.
So that will happen only when you do this for your life.
So now, from this point onwards, mental exercise starts and physical ends.
First exercise in the part is to gather the mind.
One has to let the mind free and watch it going on as an onlooker.
So what will happen in the first, when you do it, you just imagine.
You are an onlooker.
You are not going to stop any thoughts.
What I say, you are an onlooker.
You just look.
The way, suppose I'm taking an example.
Take a stone, put it into the calm lake.
Our lake has some, that is,
But suppose a calm lake or the lake or the water body in front of the guest house.
There is no struggling or there is no, this dock, nothing but there.
It is a constant water.
You put a stone to it.
So what will happen?
There will be circle, circle, circle.
Can you stop the circle?
You cannot stop the circle.
So what you have to do?
You have to, suppose you put a stone and you see there is a circle and circle, circle.
Your friend comes, this one, water is very calm and quiet and you can see the below.
What you have to do?
You have already put a stone.
You have to wait till the last circle ends.
Then only you can see the calm water of the calm lake.
Imagine our mind is just like that, calm leg.
Imagine your mind as a calm leg.
Don't do anything to your thoughts.
While you are doing this, lot of thoughts are going to come to your mind.
Because the mind is like that, subtle.
I say, no, it's so subtle a sense.
Immediately mind, you are here, your mind is now in America.
How?
Without visa, without ticket, mind goes to America.
Our mind is like that, you know.
You cannot have control over it.
You are present, your body is here, there is no visa, no air ticket, no aeroplane, but mind is there, you will say, with one of your friends.
You will be thinking about her or about him.
Or your parents.
You are here, your parents at home.
Today is the auspicious day, my mother must have done this, done that, you must be thinking now, sitting in the class.
Mind goes out.
the point is that how to control that mind how to arrest now here when you do this pranayama don't stop your mind allow the mind goes and you are an onlooker the way you are an onlooker you can
