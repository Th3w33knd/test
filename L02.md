> i want you to be a guide for me and teach me. Can we start from 09.md to 13.md as I have prepared in my last quiz?? Please don't glaze that much🙏🏻🥀. Feel free to criticise me when I am wrong. Come on, easy question, my professor will not ask these types of questions, as you know, everybody can just remember the answers, and I think most of the students are well aware of these tricks. They ask deeper questions, though. Split responses if you want to, no need to cram all the information
